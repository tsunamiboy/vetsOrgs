 i suspect the initial read will occur in AppDelegate
     and details gets set here using a variable
 use later in data fetch
 let fullText = String(contentsOfFile: path!, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
 -------------
 origin: let readin = fullText.componentsSeparatedByString("\n") as [String]
 change: create a single variable containing raw data
 let readin = rawData.componentsSeparatedByString("\n") as [String]
 rawData = "Air Force Association","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"/n"Air Force Sergeants Association","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"/n"American Ex-Prisoners of War","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"/n"American G.I.
